# Shadow and Bone Server

This is a fun side project that creates an API for the popular book series [Shadow and Bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_and_Bone).

The API uses [serverless.com](https://www.serverless.com) to create serverless endpoints on AWS API Gateway. Please check out my [companion post](https://rhythmandbinary.com/post/2022-02-17-building-a-aws-serverless-node-express-api) that includes information about how all of this works.

I also created a frontend for this project, and you can [check that out on Netlify here](https://shadow-and-bone-page.netlify.app/).

Future plans for the full version of this project are to build out `characters` endpoints and also allow for searching with query strings for values.
